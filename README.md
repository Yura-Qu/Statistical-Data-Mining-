# Statistical-Data-Mining

### Definition

> Data mining is the process of discovering patterns, correlations, and insights from large datasets using statistical and computational techniques. It involves applying various algorithms to analyze and extract useful information from structured and unstructured data sources, such as databases, data warehouses, and the internet. The goal of data mining is to extract knowledge from data and use it to make informed business decisions, identify new opportunities, and improve organizational efficiency. Some common techniques used in data mining include clustering, classification, regression analysis, association rule mining, and anomaly detection.

Data are a plentiful resource. Perhaps one can mine it for its nuggets of gold (gems of truth/insight/knowledge), i.e., sifting through vast quantities of raw data looking for valuable nuggets of business information. An analogy: sifting through piles and piles of dirt and rubbish to get at the treasure, i.e., new technologies help companies find riches buried in dormant data sets. In part, DM has been driven by individuals and organisations who find themselves with large data holdings which they feel ought to be sources of valuable information. DM has been fanned by hardware and software computer vendors looking for new market niches. See later. Some statisticians have used the term “data mining” to mean unsavoury “data dredging”, “data snooping”’ or “fishing expedition” in the search of publishable P -values. That is, the extraction of possibly spurious structure from data using exhaustive and invalid methods—torturing the data until it confesses. These criticisms of DM are about getting valid statistical inferences. Many DM methods were derived heuristically, and use brute-force computer power, e.g., trees. Consequently, their statistical properties are usually not tractable, and most standard statistical inferences based on P -values etc. are invalid. **However, the focus of DM is often prediction and not statistical inference.** There is no firm distinction between DM and statistics.
